        Digital art is an artistic work or practice that 
        uses digital technology as part of the creative or 
        presentation process. Since the 1960s, various names
         have been used to describe the process, including
          computer art and multimedia art. Digital art is 
          itself placed under the larger umbrella term new 
          media art

 <h3>pixel art</h3>
 <p>
    Pixel art is a form of digital art, created through the 
    use of software, where images are edited on the pixel 
    level. The aesthetic for this kind of graphics comes 
    from 8-bit and 16-bit computers and video game consoles, 
    in addition to other limited systems such as graphing
     calculators. In most pixel art, the color palette
      used is extremely limited in size, with some pixel
       art using only two colors.

    Creating or modifying pixel art characters
     or objects for video games is sometimes called
      spriting, a term that arose from the hobbyist community. 
      The term likely came from the term sprite,
       a term used in computer graphics to describe 
       a two-dimensional bitmap that is used in tandem 
       with other bitmaps to construct a larger scene
   
    <li>
         <ul>pixel art can be simple like this:</ul>

         <ul>
            or it can be detailed and complicated like this:

 <h3>3d art</h3>
<p>
    3D computer graphics, or three-dimensional 
    computer graphics (in contrast to 2D computer graphics),
     are graphics that use a three-dimensional representation
      of geometric data (often Cartesian) that is stored in 
      the computer for the purposes of performing calculations
       and rendering 2D images. The resulting images may be 
       stored for viewing later (possibly as an animation)
        or displayed in real time. Unlike 3D film and similar 
        techniques, the result is two-dimensional, 
        without the illusion of being solid.
